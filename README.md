#Introduction

This repository contains the materials used by team 14 in creating their project.

This project concerns EcoCity's pillar of Affordable and Accessible Housing.

The purpose of the project is to help homeless youth find temporary housing while they transition to permanent housing solutions.

This application is built to collect volunteer (host) information and allow that information to be accessed by social care workers who can match hosts (with criteria) with their charges (youths).
